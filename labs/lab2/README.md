# CSE-570 Lab 2

To modify and run:
   * Change directory to .../cse570/labs/lab2/  
   * Run "make clean" and "make" to update the project.  
   * Make sure there are name_of_in_file name_of_out_file files created to get the grammar from and output the first and follow sets.  
   * Run "'./lab2' name_of_in_file name_of_out_file" or "'lab2' name_of_in_file name_of_out_file" to run the project.  
   * The out file does not currently work. I plan on fixing it in the future.  
   * I am planning to add better features in the future.
